# Ideas log

Arduino basics can be thought of

- display: LED's, digital displays, etc
- actuation: buttons
- measurement: temperature, light, etc

Arduino can do real time hardware control

## General electronics themes

- alarms and security
- audio creation circuits - theremins
- detector circuits - smoke, gas, humidity, etc
- light and laser control
- radio circuits

## Style

- encourage "armchair scintist" readership
- open ended investigations in the spirit of Experimental Methods in RF Design - experimenting and "Homebrewing"

## Project ideas

- attach bots, that display colours or something based on something in the rails app
- game play using arduino?
- reaction timer
- logging real time events
- remote control
- weather station
- RTL-SDR ADS-B plane tracker
- citizen meta data tracker: bluetooth, wifi, etc
